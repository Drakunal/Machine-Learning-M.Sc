This data set includes 898 Pokemon, 1072 including alternate forms, including their number, name, first and second type, the stat total and basic stats: HP, Attack, Defense, Special Attack, Special Defense, and Speed, generation, and legendary status. It has been of great use when teaching statistics to kids. With certain types you can also give a geeky introduction to machine learning.

These are the raw attributes that are used for calculating how much damage an attack will do in the games. This dataset is about the pokemon games (NOT pokemon cards or Pokemon Go).

Number: The ID for each pokemon

Name: The name of each pokemon

Type 1: Each pokemon has a type, this determines weakness/resistance to attacks

Type 2: Some pokemon are dual type and have 2

Total: Sum of all stats that come after this, a general guide to how strong a pokemon is

HP: Hit points, or health, defines how much damage a pokemon can withstand before fainting

Attack: The base modifier for normal attacks (eg. Scratch, Punch)

Defense: The base damage resistance against normal attacks

SP Atk: Special attack, the base modifier for special attacks (e.g. fire blast, bubble beam)

SP Def: Special defense, the base damage resistance against special attacks

Speed: Determines which pokemon attacks first each round

Generation: The generation of games where the pokemon was first introduced

Legendary: Some pokemon are much rarer than others, and are dubbed "legendary"

Inspiration: The type of a pokemon cannot be inferred only by its Attack and Defense. It would be worthy to find which two variables can define the type of a pokemon, if any. Two variables can be plotted in a 2D space, and used as an example for machine learning. This could mean the creation of a visual example any geeky Machine Learning class would love.
